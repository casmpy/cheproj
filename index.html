                Water wastage is a significant environmental concern that affects our planet's sustainability. The
                world's population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and with the increasing demand for water
                from various sectors such as agriculture, industry, and households, water wastage has become a pressing
                issue. According to the United Nations, over two billion people live in countries experiencing high
                water stress, and this number is expected to increase to over four billion by 2050.

                Water is a finite resource, and its availability and quality are essential for human health and
                wellbeing, as well as for the environment. Wastage of water refers to the unnecessary use or excessive
                consumption of water that leads to its depletion, resulting in severe environmental and economic
                consequences. Every drop of water that is wasted has a ripple effect on the ecosystem, and the impact is
                felt by both humans and wildlife</p>

                <p class="lead">Water shortage is a pressing issue that affects many parts of the world. It is caused by
                    a combination of natural phenomena, human activities, and climate change. The effects of water
                    shortage can be severe and far-reaching, impacting public health, food security, economic
                    development, ecosystems, and social stability.

                    One of the main causes of water shortage is climate change, which has led to a decrease in rainfall
                    and an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. The growing world population
                    and increasing demand for water is another cause, putting pressure on water resources.
                    Over-extraction of groundwater, pollution, and poor water management practices also contribute to
                    water scarcity.

                    The effects of water shortage are many and varied. Public health is impacted by a lack of access to
                    clean and safe water, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and
                    diarrhea. Food security is another concern, with water shortage leading to crop failure and food
                    insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Water scarcity can also impact economic
                    development, limiting industrial growth, reducing tourism, and hindering job creation.
